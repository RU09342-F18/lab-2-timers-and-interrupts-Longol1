MSP430F5529 - For this I used the P2.1 button as an input and an interrupt. For this the pullup resistor had to be enabled and set to pullup mode. The P1.0 and P4.7 were used as the LED outputs. I configured the clock to run with SMCLK on continuous mode with an eight part divider. I set the period of the clock register to 1000. I also enabled the low power mode on this for when the cpu isnt being uesd. The timer interrupt toggles P4.7 LED, and the button interrupt toggles the P1.6 LED. 

MSP430G2553 - For this I used P1.3 button as the input and interrupt. I used the P1.0 and P1.6 as the LED outputs. I configured the clock to run using ACLK in up mode and using an 8 part divider. I set the period of the timer to 20K. I also enabled the feature to have the CPU go into low power mode when it is not being used. For this I had two interrupts one being the P1.3 button and the timer. The timer interrupt toggled P1.0 LED at 20KHz, and the button P1.3 toggled the P1.6 LED.
