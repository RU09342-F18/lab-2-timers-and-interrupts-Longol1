MSP430G2553 - For this button interrupt I used the P1.3 button. For that I had to make it an input, and set it to the interrupt pin. LED P1.0 and P1.6 are the LEDs used as outputs. Before I hit the button to start the interrupt I turn P1.0 LED off and P1.6 LED on. Then when I hit the button and trigger the interrupt the they will both toggle, and both switch from on and off at separate states.

MSPFR2311 - For this code I used P1.1 button as the input. In order to make it work I had to enable the pullup resistor, set the resistor to pull up mode, and make P1.1 an interrupt pin. P1.0 and P2.0 are the LEDs I am using as outputs. The interrupt is set to toggle the P1.0 LED when pressed. I also have inside the while loop P2.0 toggling constantly at 10KHz. For this I use an if statement and a counter that everytime the counter gets to 10K the LED will toggle and the counter will reset.
