MSP430F5529 - For this I used P2.1 button as the input and interrupt pin. I used the P1.0 as the LED output. I configured the clock to initially run at 10Hz by setting the period to 400. I first configured the clock to use ACLK, up mode, and use the 8 part divider. The timer interrupt toggles the P1.0 LED. The button interrupt is what will change the clock speed when it is being held down. The P2.1 is detected by a falling edge which triggers the interrupt. During this interrupt it will clear the clock then swtich to continuous mode so it can count pass the set period. When the rising edge is detected it stops the clock takes the period and puts it into the register to change the clock speed then switches back into up mode.
